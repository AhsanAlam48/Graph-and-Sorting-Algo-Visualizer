<h2>About</h2>
<p>This project helps in visualization of 2 graph algorithms and 6 Sorting algorithms. Two of which are graph traversal- BFS and DFS and other one is Sorting algorithm.</p>
<p>The grid can be assumed as a node having edges to top, left, bottom and right node.</p>
<p>A custom grid can be generated by putting values into the input box.</p>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p>BFS and DFS can be started by clicking on any of the box of the grid</p>
<!-- <p>For Path Finding first selected box will be start position and second selected box will be final position, and any number of boxes can be made as wall after that.
<p>Algorithm start by clicking on start button, and displays the result for 5 seconds after reaching to target node from start node.</p> -->
